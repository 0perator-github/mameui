# MAMEUI

## What is MAMEUI?

MAMEUI is a modification of the MAME project which adds a Windows-based front-end GUI to MAME.

MAMEUI essentially converts MAME to a Windows desktop application, allowing it to run from the Windows desktop. Back in 1997, before MAME had a GUI or a front-end, John IV worked on MAME32. It eventually became known as MAME(UI32/UI64) in the fall of 2007 after John IV decided to release both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Years later, in 2016, it was handed over to Robbbert, who maintained the project on GitHub until November 17, 2022, when he quit. So, I decided to start my own repository on GitHub because, for years, I've been tracking and experimenting with the code from MAMEUI.

### How to compile?

You can only build MAMEUI on a Windows computer. It won't compile on Unix.

```
make STRIP_SYMBOLS=1
```

for a full build,


```
make SUBTARGET=tiny STRIP_SYMBOLS=1
```

for a build including a small subset of supported systems.

In order to build MAMEUI using Clang use the following command:

```
make ARCOPTS='-fuse-ld=lld' OVERRIDE_AR='llvm-ar' OVERRIDE_CC='clang' OVERRIDE_CXX='clang++' STRIP_SYMBOLS=1
```

Visual Studio builds are also possible, but you'll still need a [build environment](http://www.mamedev.org/tools/) based on MinGW-w64.
In order to generate a solution and its accompanying project files, just run:

```
make vs2022
```
or use this command to build it directly using msbuild:

```
make vs2022 MSBUILD=1
```
